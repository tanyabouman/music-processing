# fft-processing
This is a project which does some processing of wav files, including fft.  The first part is in the file FFTProcessing.  This processes entire files at once.  The extension to it, StreamProcessing, does the same operations, except that it only processes one buffer of the file at a time and immediately writes that buffer to the output file.
